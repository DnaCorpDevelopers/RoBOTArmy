_We are many... and we don't sleep..._

# RoBOTArmy
An army of bots for Discord! These bots are used in our private/fun server and are mainly used to entertain us or to scrap some information from the [Egosoft Forums](http://forum.egosoft.com).

All the bots are written in `Python` and some have `Jupyter Notebooks` that are used to test some code. 

## BasicBot

This bot does nothing. It is just an _abstract_ bot that offers some basic methods common to all bots, such as anchor to a channel or perform commands based on the received message.

## JoeTheBarman

Your faithful barman! You can request drinks for your evenings.

(It currently has commands in Italian only)

## StalkyDroid

Like a good stalker-droid, this bot collect and notifies the posts of EGOSOFT members on the official forums, so we don't lose a single drop of knowledge :)
